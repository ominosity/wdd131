            <h2>Mosiah 4:3</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and
                they were filled
                with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the
                exceeding faith
                which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken
                unto them.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 18:25</h2>
            <p>And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye
                should come unto me,
                that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment
                suffereth
                himself to be led into temptation.</p>
