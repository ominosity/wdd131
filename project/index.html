        Subject - Wild Western Oregon

        Content - A website highlighting our outdoor travels in the Western regions of Oregon. I'm thinking potential
        pages
        could be:
        * The Coast
        * Waterfalls
        * Food and drink, the best restaurants we've tried

        Reason - My wife and I were born and raised in Utah. Three years ago, when I was 42, we visited the Oregon coast
        and
        fell in love. Within the year we moved into a new home we built in Albany. I want to share some of the pictures
        we've
        taken and places we've gone that either inspired us to relocate here or that have solidified our love of western
        half of
        the state.
